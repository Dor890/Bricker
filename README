The project is divided to packages and classes according to different strategies and objects:
Each object in the game is implemented through a specific class, each extends GameObejct class:
Ball, Puck, Brick, Paddle, MockPaddle, NumericLifeCounter and NumericLifeCounter,
where Puck extends Ball as being a specific kind of a ball, exactly as Mockpaddle extends Paddle.
The last game object, BallCollisionCountdownAgent is only responsible for following each frame (by update
method) and check the ball collision counter, so for that it is implemented as an object but not being
rendered to the screen.
On the other hands, there are the strategies. CollisionStrategy is the interface which they are all
implements, and RemoveBrickStrategyDecorator which they all inherits, in order to avoid code duplication
for breaking a single brick, and that way each strategy decorated the RemoveBrickStrategy that is needed
to be implemented in any case.

In order to use this repository, you will need to use the DanoGameLab external library, which I uploaded here as an internal directory in "src".
